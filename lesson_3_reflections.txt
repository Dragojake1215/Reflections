When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Well mainly for collaborating with other people, so they can edit files and commit too. Also incase you want a backup of the files on your computer on github so you can get them later.

Why might you always want to pull change manually rather then having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

	Well if multiple people are working on it, and different people are working on different features, and your focusing on your feature and them on thiers, and he makes a commit you don't have to pull it unless your ready for it; so you don't get unwanted code.
